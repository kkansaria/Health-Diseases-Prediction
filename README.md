# Health-Diseases-prediction


As a part of our academics, we have created this project where we have trained two machine learning models and integrated them with Django.
we have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to handle our frontend.
PostgresSQL is used as a database to handle our data.

Working:
Step 1: User will get registered with the system. 
Step 2: The UI portal has 3 options , patients , doctor and admin. 
Step 3 : As per the role selection during the registeration process , access and rights will be given .
Step 4 : There would be list of symptoms which would be selected by user . Based on the symptoms selection ,it would give the confidence score.
Step 5: The confidence score generation is done by training 2 model naive bayes and random forest classifier which helps in predictive analysis.
Step 6: Based on the data set extracted from kaggle , analysis was performed.
Step 7: Python libraries (Seaborn, Matplotlib, plotly, Pandas, numpy) were used for visualization.
